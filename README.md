# Week 5 Homework

Your assignment for this week is to build a working clock using JavaScript.

The clock should display the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.  It should update the time every second.

Requirements:
- The clock must display the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- The clock must update every second.
- The value for hours should only be between 1 and 12.  No military time.
- The `#period` element should display either "AM" or "PM" depending on the current time.
- The `#icon` element should display either the sun or moon icon depending on the current time.  Assume "day" is between 7 AM and 7 PM and that "night" is between 7 PM and 7 AM.
- Fill in each icon in an appropriate color (can you color the stars in the icon differently than the moon?)
- Please restyle the clock - I don't care *what* it looks like, just as long as it's not black / white / Helvetica in the end.
Use the HTML structure that I've provided to start.  Feel free to add additional elements if you need them for design or layout purposes.
